## Selection Sort

- **Selection Sort** works by repeatedly finding the minimum (or maximum) element from the unsorted portion of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:**O(1)

## Bubble Sort

- **Bubble Sort**

  - It works by comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
  - Traverse the array from the start to the end.
  - Compare each pair of adjacent elements and swap them if necessary.
  - After each pass, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position.
  - Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted portion of the array until no swaps are needed.

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
